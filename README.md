# Novel_to_pdf
This project was completed in the Jupyter notebook using the Beautifulsoup module of BS4 and the Python scripting language.

This is a web scraping script that quickly and efficiently scrapes novel chapters from websites (in this case, "https://tales.xperimentalhamid.com/") and then compiles them into PDF files. It's irritating to keep clicking "next chapter" when reading online with advertisements. As a result, I wrote this script. I hope you enjoy it.
