# Novel_to_pdf
This is a web scraping script that collects novel chapters from websites (in this case, https://tales.xperimentalhamid.com/) quickly and easily, and then compiles them into PDF files.
It is annoying to constantly click "next chapter" when reading online with ads. I created this script as a result. Hope you like it
